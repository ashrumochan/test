Hi Team,
Greetings of the Day!!!
Thanks for the offer.
I have some concerns regarding the offer:
1. I have asked for Hyderabad location, but the offered you have given is from Bangalore Location. As i got married recently and left my previous job to relocate to Hyderabad. It is not feasible for me relocate again to Bangalore.
2. As per my discussion with HR, regarding salary compensation, i have requested for 9LPA. But the offer you have given me is 6.9LPA which is lesser then the current offer i am having.
With this salary compensation, I will not be able to join your firm.

Thanks and Regards,
Abhilasha Shivhare
