Dear All,

After more than 2.5 years of exciting and memorable stint with ICICI, I am bidding adieu today i.e.; on 12th February 2019 to this company to pursue other career opportunities. As I move on, I would like to take a moment to remember and cherish our times together. It’s been great interacting and knowing each one of you. Even though I will miss you all here I am looking forward to this new challenge and to start a new phase of my career.
This is not a goodbye, only “see you later”.
Good luck and wish you all the best in your venture!
Do stay in touch…
